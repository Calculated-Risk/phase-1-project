# Project Title
infoNation: Explore Countries


# Project Description
Flatiron School's phase - 1 project. This project allows users to interact with a simple search feature, type in a country name, click "Let's See Results" submit button and receive data about the country. The data returned by the API will be:

1. Country Name & Flag
2. Population of the country
3. Is the country a member of the United Nations?
4. What region is the country located in?
5. What side of the road do people drive?
6. A Google maps link is provided for the given country


The technology used for this application is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some challenges came from trying to use/remember certain methods to apply in the JS file. Code structure was also something I tried keeping in mind as I continued writing new lines. There are some features in the future I would love to implement, for more info please see NOTES.md.
